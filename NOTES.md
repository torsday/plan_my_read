## Thoughts

Have "chunks". belonging to a user and a book. The book is divided up. This allows a user to check that they've read a part of a book, even if they haven't done so linearly.

a book list has chunks
a book list knows the size the chunks should be
a chunk only knows how big it is, what book it is, first page, last page

there is a method to recalculate chunks, that a user can trigger, but not automatically

books, within book list page
  drag/drop prioritization/ordering

ability to create very detailed schedules (break books into chunks, arrange however you like)

ability to share book lists for others (read only subscription, or make it your own, and it becomes your own)


books [can] have units
books [can] have chapters
units and chapters have a start and end page, and a total page count
units and chapters can be submitted by the user. Users submit their own pages.
users can correct the pages for themselves.
users can earn points (kharma) for submitting chapters and units
points can be used for... what?

if a book has chapters or units, chunking tries to align with those breakpoints

> “Surface Skimming” - the opposite of “Rabbit Holing”. The belief that you understand something by making many quick passes over its surface

plans rate quality (e.g. surface skimming vs rabbit holing...), and give a heatmap [for the chunks]?

rather than chapters, units, have recursive chunks; chunks within chunks, within chunks. They can get as detailed as need be. All user generated
A chunk can have meta content, user votes, user comments, user inputs...?

List creatiion
  chunks on the left
  list on the right
  chunks on the left can be folded open/closed
  any chunk can be dragged over
  height on either side is representative of page count



list sharing
  with dates
  without dates
